## Optimizations % NgModules

What are the Modules ?
1. AppModule
	1. AppComponent
	2. ProductsComponent
	3. HighlightDirective
	4. ProductService
2. Angluar analyze NgModules to "understand" your application and its features
3. Angular modules define all building blocks your app uses: Components, Directives, Services
4. An app requries at least one module (AppModule) but may be split into multiple modules
5. Core Angular features are included in Angular modules (eg. FormsModule) to load them only when needed.
6. You can't use features/building block without including it in module.
