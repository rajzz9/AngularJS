## Components 
1. Angular in the end is a JS framework, changing your DOM ("HTML") at runtime.
2. Components are sections in UI page.
3. In angular is root component is app components in general, that defined in app.module.ts file
	bootstrap: [AppComponent]

## Creating new Components
1. ng generate component <component_name> (or) ng g c <component_name>
2. adding component details to app.module.ts file like below 
3. NgModule having:
	1. declarations -- Any new module will create, need to add in this array. 
	2. imports
	3. providers
	4. bootstrap: -- Used to start the application , uses index.html 
4. templates: '' , Here we can write html code directly or component selector name.
4. Style in templets

## Databinding
1. Databinding == Communication
2. Typescript =========================>> Template(HTML)
					Output Data
		1. String Interpolation ( {{data}} )
		2. Property Binding ([property] = "data")
	
   Typescript <<========================= Template(HTML)
				Rect to User Events
		1.  Event binding(event) = "expression"
3. Combination of both : Two-way binding ( [(ngModel)] ="data" )

## Events
1. For events, you don't bind to onclick but only to click (=> (click)).

## Two-Way-Binding
Important: For Two-Way-Binding (covered in the next lecture) to work, you need to enable the ngModel  directive.
This is done by adding the FormsModule  to the imports[]  array in the AppModule.
You then also need to add the import from @angular/forms  in the app.module.ts file:

import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
