## Service and dependency injection
1. Its like an normal class and wirte useful methods and use it in components.
2. Dependency injection is will avable 
	ex: constructor(private loggingService: LoggingService){}
		@Component({
			...,
			...,
			...,
			providers: [LoggingService]
		})
	In LoggingService class object automatically inject into your class,that will take care by Angular.
3. In app.module.ts file add 
	providers: [
				..,
				.., 	// Add your services, it will visible for entire your application.
				..
				]
4. Injecting services into services,
	i. @Injectable()

5. Communicating components with service is very easy.

6. For new service 
	ex: ng generate service <your_service_name>
		(or)
		ng g s <your_service_name>
